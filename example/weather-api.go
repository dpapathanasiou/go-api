// weather-api.go
//
// This is a simple example of how to use the api package.
// 
// The getWeather() function takes the NOAA station id for a given location (full list at http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/)
// and returns the current weather conditions as an xml-formatted string.
//
// Inside main(), getWeather is assigned to respond to requests where "/weather" is found in the url from the client;
// it will send its responses back in text/xml format, using utf-8, back to the client.
//
// This example server runs on port 9001, and so any request in the form:
//
// http://[localhost/domain/ip of server]:9001/weather?q=[station id]
//
// will work, as long as [station id] corresponds to a valid NOAA value.
//
// Optionally, the request can include an hmac digest for security:
//
// http://[localhost/domain/ip of server]:9001/weather?q=[station id]&d=[hmac digest of "q" in sha1 with a shared private key]
//
// The "d" parameter is a sha1 digest of the station id using "secret" as the shared private key in this example
// (in practice, the private key is known only by the authorized api client and the server -- see 
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmac for more details on how it works).

// to the api.Respond function (which defines both the media type and the charset), which calls
// the function which actually processes the client request, and returns a string in the expected 
// format. This example defines just one pattern and response (i.e., "/weather" returns an xml
// reply in utf-8), but other patterns and response functions can be added to the multiplexer.
